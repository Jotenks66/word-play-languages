# Word Play (by Game Maker's Toolkit) - Language Mods
Language mods for the Word Play game by Game Maker's Toolkit

## How to use

First, you'll need to find the folder with your save game in it. Here's where to get it:

### Mac
Users/YourUserName/Library/Application Support/com.GMTK.WordPlay

### PC
YourUserName/AppData/LocalLow/Game Maker's Toolkit/Word Play

You may need to show hidden files or folders to get here!

Then simply add the customdictionary.txt and customletterbag.txt of the desired language.

The game should show "Custom Dictionary" in the bottom left corner.
